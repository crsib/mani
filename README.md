Máni - the Lua 5.1/LuaJIT 2.0 C++ Wrapper
=========================================

## About

Máni is designed to be a part of the Freya3D engine. 

### What's Up With the Name?

In Norse mythology, Máni (Old Norse/Icelandic "moon") is the moon personified. While being designed to be the part
of Freya3D Engine Norse mythology seems to be a good choice for the yet another to way to play with the Lua name ;)
More over - Luna (which is moon in Russian) is already taken :)

## Usage
