Máni - the Lua 5.1/LuaJIT 2.0 C++ Wrapper
=========================================

## About

Máni is a relatively small, header-only C++03 Lua wrapper with virtually 
no dependencies except for the Lua itself and a small subset of LibC.  Still, it uses some features of the C++03,
which requires a good, modern C++ compiler.

### What's Up With the Name?

In Norse mythology, Máni (Old Norse/Icelandic "moon") is the moon personified. While originally being designed to be the part
of Freya3D Engine Norse mythology seems to be a good choice for the yet another to way to play with the Lua name ;)
More over - Luna (which is @moon" in Russian) is already taken :)
